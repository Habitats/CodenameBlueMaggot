Welcome!

This is a game about killing eachother, as most games these days are.
It draws inspiration from games such as Liero, Super Smash Bros and the MS DOS classic, Gorillas.

The idea was concieved by three students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology: 
Eirik Jakobsen, Patrick Skjennum and Olav Olseng.
