Welcome!

This is a game about killing eachother, as most games these days are.
It draws inspiration from games such as Liero, Super Smash Bros and the MS DOS classic, Gorillas.

The idea was concieved by three students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology: 
Eirik Jakobsen, Patrick Skjennum and Olav Olseng.

1.	Installing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
	The game should come packaged as a .rar file, which should contain everything you need to run
	the game. The .jar game file (which is what you use to run the game), the lvl folder, and 
	this README. The .jar and the .lvl folder must be located in the same folder for the game to load! 
	
	The game is built with the Java SDK 1.6, so to run it, you at least need the 
	Java Runtime Environment version 6, which can be downloaded for free here:
	http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp
	
	Once you have the JRE installed, you should be able to run the game by running the .jar file.
	
	
	1.1 Installing your own maps
		
		To put your own maps into the game, all you need is an image with the proper settings. These are
		as follows:
		
			1. A terrain picture.
				The alpha mask is -1 (0xFFFFFF) in RGB, this means that the places on your picture should
				you want your tanks to not collide with the terrain should use this color. To load 
				the terrain into the game, give it a name followed by "_terrain.png", for instance:
				grassyHills_terrain.png
				
				
			2. (Optional) A background picture
				If you do not create a specific background for your level, it will automatically
				become black. The background picture should have the same name as the terrain picture, 
				followed by "_background.png". for instance:
				grassyHills_background.png

			NOTE!
				ARGB is not oficially supported. The supported resolutions are 1280x720. 
				The formats supported are .png. The game only supports twelve (12) levels at a time, 
				so to get any new levels into the game, you need to remove one of the other 
				levels from the .lvl folder.

2.	The Menu Screen
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

		IMPORTANT!
		For the game to read any input into textfields, you have to press 'Enter' to verify your input.
		the textfield should turn green when the game has read the input properly.
		
		2.1 The Return Button
			Returns you to a game if one is currently running.
		
		2.2 The New Game Button
			Starts a new local multiplayer game on the selected map.
			
		2.3 The New LAN Game Button
			Starts a LAN game on the selected map. The host should check the isHost button. The
			connecting players should put in the correct IPv4 address and press enter to verify,
			if the IP address is valid, the textfield should turn green. The host must start the game
			first, and once the other peers connect, the game will commence.
			
		2.4 The Level Select Button
			Here you can select the level you will play on, just press the desired map, and the border
			around the level should turn green, then press apply.
			
		2.5	The Control button
			Here you can rebind the key inputs to your own taste. The LAN and Offline buttons will
			default the key mapping to recomended defaults. To rebind a key, press a textfield, insert
			the desired key and verify using enter.

3. The Game
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Inside the game, the overlay at the top of the screen shows the remaining lives (represented by 
	hearts) of each player, their respective accumulated score and their currently selected weapons.
	You start every life with only the shellgun and the grenade, of which you have unlimited ammo.
	You lose a life everytime you leave the boundries of the map, very much like Smash Bros for the 
	N64. For each hit you take, the amount you get pushed back is increased, making it harder to 
	stay within the boundries of map.
	
	Crates:
		The game will spawn weapon crates on the map, adding a powerful weapon with limited ammo to
		your arsenal.
		
	BubbleHearths:
		The BubbleHearth item will reduce the damage you have taken by 200%. This is useful for not
		dieing.

	The game can be played in two ways:
		
		1. Score hoarder
				The player with the most score at the end of the game wins. You gain a 100 score
				every time you pickup a scorebubble, and lose 100 points everytime you lose a life.
				
		2. Last man standing
			The last player alive is the victor
			
	3.1 Controls
		Your tank is controlled accordingly to the keys you set in the "Control" option in the main
		menu. Most projectiles will travel faster the longer you hold the fire button. It will go in
		the direction of your reticule.
		Pressing the JETPACK button, will propell your tank upwards. Beware, that your jetpack has
		limited fuel, that regenerates slowly over time. Use it accordingly.
